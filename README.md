# home-soc-detection-lab
Designed and implemented a home SOC lab to practice detection engineering and incident response.  Integrated Suricata (network IDS/IPS),  Wazuh (EDR), Logstash (parsing and normalization),  
Splunk (SIEM) with MITRE ATT&amp;CK-aligned detection rules.  
Simulated attacker behavior to validate detection coverage and built basic SOAR automation via webhook
